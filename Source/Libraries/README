Right now, not much is here. Generally we have two portions for this section
one is a pointer table. This makes things a lot easier to deal with, as well, 
we can now more dynamically resize the scripts we are running. This would 
allow us to keep track of all the pointers we are using in the current 
session of PDA ZX, and if we have changed them within PDA ZX, simply modify 
the ROM itself.

Say we took a script, and expanded the amount of instructions in it by four. 
This would cause an issue of having to instead make a new script at the end 
of the ROM. Here what we do, is keep track of all the pointers in our current 
game Modding session, and when we need to expand a function, update where the 
new pointer locations are--then anything we have noted as talking to that 
pointer location, tell it the new place to point.

It should be noted that scripts can only be expanded as far as the databank 
will allow them to.

The other part is an object designed mostly to allow the user of PDA ZX to 
tell the database where certain libraries of data are in the game, as well as 
the required format of the library.

Library information should not be hardcode, however should instead be ran 
by forms of input into PDA ZX, then stored into the database we will be 
using.
