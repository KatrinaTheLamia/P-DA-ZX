Directory $PDAZX/Source/Data/Libraries

This directory is mostly related to modification of Nintendo games, or 
in some cases, grabbing information from those games. The main point of 
this section is to include enough informations to allow for P*DA ZX to 
operate as a disassembler/assembler type setup for the targetted systems,
but to also contain the information on where certain functions are in the 
various games it is based on.

The idea being that this section of code can grab various functions from 
the game's information and put it into a more local spot to deal with. It 
will also allow us to add information into the game.

It should be noted that music and graphics can be considered RAW scrips in 
the format this code allows for.

For now, we will simply list the data in this section as a blob associated 
with the system it is on.

So we could have for types:
RaddTeam::PDAZX::Blob::Z80
RaddTeam::PDAZX::Blob::m6802
RaddTeam::PDAZX::Blob::MIPS
RaddTeam::PDAZX::Blob::ARM
RaddTeam::PDAZX::Blob::PPC

Holder entries for DC have been given for future usages.
