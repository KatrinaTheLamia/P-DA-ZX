Directory $PDAZX/Source/Flow

This directory is designed for items in P*DA ZX that are not specific to one 
particular area of code. These are mostly constructs that exist all around.

Such as things like Signals and Compatibility functionality.

Generally the only thing in here that should be called directly into your 
code is widget.h--unless you have good reason to pick and choose.
