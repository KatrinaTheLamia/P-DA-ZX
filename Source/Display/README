Directory: $PDAZX/Source/Display

Where as the stuff in $PDAZX/Source/Devices/Display are for output only, this 
directory is more based on handling and manipulating the display data we are 
using. Handling different graphics formats or in some cases just creating 
some manner of display output for our target. Nothing really special here 
though, however.
