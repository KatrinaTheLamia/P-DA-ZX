Directory: $PDA/Source/Devices

This directory is mostly meant to contain source files denoting information 
on limitations inherent in the various targets we plan to touch with this 
toolkit.

Each device will have a few components.

1) Information on what that device can and cannot allow. This is more a lookup
   Utility of sorts that can be used here.

2) Information to writing to said device. In the case that the target we are 
   on, somehow has the device accessible, we prolly should know how to talk 
   to that device.

3) Emulation of the device. If we try to write to the device, and we do not 
   have access to it--we should at least try to figure out a way to best 
   output what we want with what we have. Some issues may arise in the case 
   of running from NDS output to the resources an NES has.

4) Each device's main level item (display.h, input.h, mixer.h network.h) 
   should be able to be asked if this device is capable of the feature we are 
   asking about.
