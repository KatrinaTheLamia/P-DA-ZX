This directory contains information for dealing with Database information.

In the case of SQLite and Kirbybase, the interactions will likely end up 
being local in nature.

In the case of MySQL and PostgreSQL we will be talking over a network to the 
database we desire. Since I am generally going to expect a large amount of 
latency involved, I am going to be working on getting things to operate in a 
manner that MySQL and PostgreSQL are _very_ light on how they handle their 
transactions.

I will allow for the option for MySQL and PostgreSQL to forward queries. 
However, that will be off by default.

Another option that is planned, but off by default, is to allow others to 
talk to the SQLite and Kirbybase DBs. Still need to consider the security 
items involved here.
