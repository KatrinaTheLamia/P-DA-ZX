Directory: $PDAZX/Source/CPU_NFO

This section is mostly for dealing with dynamic disassembling and 
reassembling within PDA ZX. The idea here is that to better edit a 
program, it helps if you can edit the scripts in the source on the 
fly.

This is mostly for additional help gained via ASM in the game. There 
will be a seperate tool for dealing with scripts and functions that 
are provided by the various Pokemon games.
